This repo will possibly become an entry to the [binny birthday jam](https://itch.io/jam/binnys-birthday-jam-2022)

## Outline
You commandeer a ship (nautical term™) and you have cannons. What you do not have is gold.
So sail away, plunder some ships, and upgrade yours.
Upgrades give you extended range, more cannons (shoot in parallel), 
Bathe (nautical term™) in the nostalgic feeling of playing a totally underrated mini game from a traditional Point&Click adventure from somewhere deep in the carribean.
